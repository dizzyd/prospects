# Prospects

This mod provides items and world decorations that makes it possible to find ore and mineral deposits in the Minecraft world. It does this in an immersive way, providing flowers to mark large deposits and items that may reveals what is in the ground beneath your feet.

Due to the mod's nature, it's not particularly useful with vanilla ore generation. Because ore is normally distributed, you'll likely just turn up iron nuggets most of the time, occasionally gold nuggets. Therefore, the mod is designed for and intended to be used with mods or mod packs that generate ore in large, spare clusters.

This mod was originally called "Prospecting" by Azathoth (https://github.com/azacock/Prospecting). They released the code to the Public Domain and indicated on Curseforge
that they were not intending to move from 1.7.10. Accordingly, I took the code and ported it (and rewrote large swaths of it) to learn how to mod. I have maintained the
original commits logs in this repo as acknowledgement of their work. Furthermore, this code remains licensing to the Public Domain. Thank you, Azathoth!
